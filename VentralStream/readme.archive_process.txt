This SpineML project has been readied for archival simply by zipping
the .bin files.

Before opening the project in SpineCreator, or before running it, you
should first unarchive:

for i in *.zip; do
  unzip $i
done

These .bin files were zipped so that they would 'fit' on github, which
requires large file support for files that get towards 50MB.
